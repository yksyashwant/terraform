State
Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.
This state is stored by default in a local file named "terraform.tfstate
The primary purpose of Terraform state is to store bindings between objects in a remote system and resource instances declared in your configuration.
